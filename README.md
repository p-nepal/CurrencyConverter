Currency Converter

This project is a Currency Converter built in Java using JFrame for the user interface. It allows users to convert amounts between different currencies using static exchange rates. The application provides a simple graphical interface for the conversion process, making it accessible and user-friendly.
üöÄ Features

    Convert between various currencies using static exchange rates.

    Simple and intuitive JFrame graphical user interface (GUI).

    User input validation to ensure valid data entry.

    A variety of versions included in the repository, with newer entries reflecting more recent updates and features.

üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

    Programming Language: Java

    GUI Framework: JFrame (Swing)

    Static Data: Predefined exchange rates stored in the code.

üìù How It Works

    User Input: The user is prompted to input the amount of money they wish to convert, as well as the source and target currencies via the graphical interface.

    Currency Selection: The user selects the source and target currencies from a dropdown menu.

    Conversion Logic: The program calculates the equivalent amount in the target currency using static exchange rates defined in the code.

    Result Display: The result is displayed on the interface, showing the converted amount.

üöÄ How to Use
Prerequisites

    Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system (preferably version 8 or higher).

    IDE: IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or any Java IDE for easier development.

Steps to Run

    Clone this repository or download the project files:

    git clone https://github.com/pranay-nep/CurrencyConverter.git

    Navigate to the project folder in your terminal or command prompt:

    cd CurrencyConverter

    Compile the program (or simply open it in your IDE):

    javac main.java

    Run the program:

    java main

    Follow the prompts on the GUI to enter the amount and select the currencies to convert.

üìö How to Improve the Layout

While the application provides a basic JFrame layout, the user interface can be further enhanced by:

    Improved Layout Management:

        Using more advanced layout managers (e.g., GridBagLayout or GroupLayout) for better control over component alignment.

        Utilizing JPanel to organize sections of the UI (e.g., input fields, buttons, result area) for a cleaner design.

    Styling and Theming:

        Adding custom fonts and colors to improve the visual appeal.

        Implementing modern UI elements, such as JComboBox for currency selection, and JTextField for amount input, with input validation feedback.

    Responsive Design:

        Ensuring the window resizes gracefully and maintains proper alignment of components.

    Error Handling:

        Enhancing error handling for invalid user inputs, such as non-numeric amounts or invalid currency selection.

üîÑ Version History

This repository contains several versions of the Currency Converter. The newest files in the repository represent the most updated versions of the code, with improved features, bug fixes, and design changes.

    Version 1: Initial release with basic currency conversion functionality and console-based interface.

    Version 2: Introduced JFrame UI, basic currency input and output via graphical interface.

    Version 3: Further UI refinements and improved input validation, static exchange rates.

üìö Learning Outcomes

Building this project helped me strengthen my understanding of:

    Java GUI programming with JFrame and Swing.

    How to implement currency conversion algorithms using static data.

    Handling user input validation in a graphical application.

    Using Java classes and methods to organize and modularize code.

üìå Future Improvements

    Real-time Exchange Rates: Integrating a currency API (like ExchangeRate-API or Fixer.io) to fetch real-time exchange rates.

    GUI Enhancements: Implementing modern UI frameworks (e.g., JavaFX) or even mobile versions using Android Studio.

    Additional Features: Adding support for more currencies and custom exchange rates.
